1.	Turing Test Exercise 
I had a conversation with Chat GPT and we discussed general topics such as assignments, TV shows, childhood dreams, and personal experiences. At the beginning, the responses from the chatbot felt quite human because it showed understanding and asked me follow-up questions. It also responded with natural expressions and showed empathy. However, the difference became clear when I asked about its own experiences and it explained that it does not have personal experiences the way humans do. This proved that although the chatbot mimics human-like responses during conversations, it ultimately lacks emotional depth.


2.	Facial Recognition and NLP activities
During the facial recognition exercise, I used a demo on FacePlusPlus and it showed the age, gender and head pose of each person in the picture. It also showed if they were smiling, if they were wearing glasses and if their eyes were open or not.
Observations during each NLP activity:
Question Answering – The system responded concisely and gave me links to websites for further research, showing how NLP models produce responses based on context.
Spam Detection – Certain messages with excessive links and coercive language were marked as spam, showing how NLP models detect patterns in spam messages.
Sentiment Analysis – I tested different product reviews and the tool accurately analysed the sentiment of each review, accurately demonstrating how NLP models interpret tone in text.
Machine Translation – Some words were translated correctly but a few phrases and sentences were translated incorrectly showing how NLP models struggle with context during translation.
Spelling Correction – The tool corrected all wrong spellings, showing the ability of NLP models to detect and correct wrong spellings.
Speech Recognition – Although the transcription was mostly accurate, it occasionally misheard words due to background noise, highlighting the inability of NLP models to isolate audio.
Chatbot Interaction – The chatbot gave repetitive, automated responses and struggled with complex questions, reflecting the limitations of NLP models.
The ‘facial recognition’ and NLP activities showcased the AI’s ability to detect human emotion through text, evaluate facial expressions and transcribe audio. However, they also highlighted various limitations such NLP system’s heavy reliance on context.


3.	Intelligent Agents
Working with intelligent agents showed how decision-making affects outcomes in different scenarios. When factors such as the amount of food eaten or work done by the ants was changed, the ants adapted to these changes. Each time a decision was made, the ants gained benefits but faced challenges at the same time. No decision was completely foolproof. Every new decision led to new scenarios that required further decision-making, illustrating the adaptive behavior of rule-based systems.


4.	Mini Project - Build a Simple AI Application

Process:
1.	We planned the simple interaction between the chatbot and the user.
2.	We implemented python’s input() function to collect the user’s name.
3.	We implemented the datetime module to display the current date.
4.	We implemented the strftime() method to display the date in a human-readable form
5.	We ran the code and it provided a friendly, natural response

Challenges
1.	It took some time to learn about how the strftime() method works
2.	Multiple rounds of testing were required to make the chatbot’s responses friendly and natural.
3.	We tested with different inputs such as numbers and special characters to make sure the program didn’t crash under any circumstance.

Lesson Learned

Although this chatbot is simple and rule-based, it required multiple rounds of testing. Creating this chatbot reflected the amount of time, data and testing it would take to train a more complex AI model.
